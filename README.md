## 🚀 About Me (Not Your Typical Developer Intro)
I’m Mohan — the guy who builds **full-stack systems**, battles **DSA problems at 2 AM**, crafts **real-world applications**, and loves connecting technology to everyday problems.

While many build projects, I build **systems that actually get used** — from  
🍱 reducing food waste,  
🏥 decoding messy prescriptions using AI,  
📦 tracking 100+ inventory items in real-time,  
🎮 and even crafting VR escape rooms.  

I believe **software should be fast, useful, and elegant** — not just “working.”
